# Using your PowerEver!

Before start using PowerEver, please make sure that you are using it with a 5V USB port of your power bank
and not 12V port available in some power banks, otherwise the unit will be permanently damaged.

Connect the unit between a power bank and a target electronic boards to be powered using an appropriate cable 
e.g. USB - Micro USB.  For a direct electrical wire connection, use a USB to 5p screw terminal adapter by connecting 
plus (+) and minus (-) terminal poles. Most of the power banks will now supply a power continuously without shutting down.

However, if the unit still keep shutting down, shortly press a push button switch on the backside one or more time 
(each time about 1 mA more current will be drawn) then re-connect with the power bank again. Repeat this step until 
the power bank becomes on permanently. 

Note

- Pressing the button longer than a few seconds will revert the previous action (status LED blinks 2 times).
- LED will blink 5 times if the lower and upper limits of the adjustment have been reached. 
- It is recommended to reduce the unitâ€™s current consumption step by step while keep your system running to minimize 
unnecessary power loss.

Resetting Factory Default

Remove the unit from the power bank, keep pressing the push button, connect it to the power bank and wait until the LED 
is blinking 5 time then release the button. The unit will now in a default factory setup state that should work fine
for a majority of power banks in the market.

Thank you for choosing and using PowerEver!
